# Plane-Seats-Management-System
As the 1st year coursework, I developed a Java application which provides an efficient and accurate user experience when allocating seats and displaying ticket information, using data structures and Object-oriented programming(OOP) concepts. The customerâ€™s data is stored in a file when the seat is reserved or deletes if cancelled.
